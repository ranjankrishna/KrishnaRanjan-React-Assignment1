But Nero is determined to rid Rome of Christians, and does not flinch from executing them in the grisliest ways possible. Before Paul's death sentence can be enacted, Luke resolves to write another book, one that details the beginnings of \\\"The Way\\\" and the birth of what will come to be known as the church. Bound in chains, Paul's struggle is internal. He has survived so much-floggings, shipwreck, starvation, stoning, hunger and thirst, cold and exposure-yet as he waits for his appointment with death, he is haunted by the shadows of his past misdeeds. Alone in the dark, he wonders if he has been forgotten . . . and if he has the strength to finish well. Two men struggle against a determined emperor and the frailties of the human spirit in order to live out the Gospel of Jesus...\",\n      \"actors\": [\n        \"James Faulkner\",\n        \"Jim Caviezel\",\n        \"Joanne Whalley\"\n      ],\n      \"imdbRating\": 0,\n      \"posterurl\": \"sample-files/MV5BMWRkYTQ4NzctMDAwYS00NmE3LWI5NzUtMTMzNTQ0MDgwOWI1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyODQyOTY2OTA@._V1_SY500_CR0,0,337,500_AL_.jpg\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"35\",\n      \"title\": \"Midnight Sun\",\n      \"year\": \"2018\",\n      \"genres\": [\n        \"Drama\",\n        \"Romance\"\n      ],\n      \"ratings\": [\n        6,\n        4,\n        8,\n        2,\n        6,\n        9,\n        6,\n        1,\n        10,\n        8,\n        3,\n        2,\n        4,\n        10,\n        4,\n        10,\n        8,\n        5,\n        4,\n        7,\n        4,\n        8,\n        1,\n        5,\n        5,\n        1,\n        9,\n        9,\n        9,\n        10\n      ],\n      \"poster\": \"MV5BMjg0NjU1MjgyNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzc5NjYyNDM@._V1_SY500_CR0,0,337,500_AL_.jpg\",\n      \"contentRating\": \"PG-13\",\n      \"duration\": \"\",\n      \"releaseDate\": \"2018-03-30\",\n      \"averageRating\": 0,\n      \"originalTitle\": \"\",\n      \"storyline\": \"Based on the Japanese film, Midnight Sun centers on Katie, a 17-year-old sheltered since childhood and confined to her house during the day by a rare disease that makes even the smallest amount of sunlight deadly.

So begins not only the story of an offbeat friendship, but, seen through the eyes of Lord, an insight into the beauty, frustration, profundity and, at times, downright chaos of the artistic process. FINAL PORTRAIT is a portrait of a genius, and of a friendship between two men who are utterly different, yet increasingly bonded through a single, ever-evolving act of creativity. It is a film which shines a light on the artistic process itself, by turns exhilarating, exasperating and bewildering, questioning whether the gift of a great artist is a blessing or a curse.\",\n      \"actors\": [\n        \"Armie Hammer\",\n        \"Clémence Poésy\",\n        \"Tony Shalhoub\"\n      ],\n      \"imdbRating\": 6.4,\n      \"posterurl\": \"sample-files/MV5BMTUwMDc0NTU1MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTcxOTk3MjI@._V1_SY500_CR0,0,337,500_AL_.jpg\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"38\",\n      \"title\": \"Izzy Gets the F*ck Across Town\",\n      \"year\": \"2017\",\n      \"genres\": [\n        \"Comedy\",\n        \"Drama\"\n      ],\n      \"ratings\": [\n        9,\n        6,\n        1,\n        4,\n        5,\n        10,\n        5,\n        8,\n        2,\n        5,\n        7,\n        5,\n        5,\n        9,\n        10,\n        1,\n        8,\n        6,\n        2,\n        4,\n        9,\n        2,\n        3,\n        8,\n        7,\n        7,\n        2,\n        6,\n        9,\n        1\n      ],\n      \"poster\": \"MV5BYTY2OTdlY2YtMWVlYy00ZjU4LWE2ODEtZWIxMDJjYTE0MjkwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTMzNzIxODA@._V1_SY480_SX317_AL_.jpg\",\n      \"contentRating\": \"\",\n      \"duration\": \"PT86M\",\n      \"releaseDate\": \"2018-03\",\n      \"averageRating\": 0,\n      \"originalTitle\": \"\",\n      \"storyline\": \"Broke, job hopping, indie musician, Izzy has just discovered that her ex-boyfriend- her soulmate!- got engaged to her ex-best friend, and their party happens to be tonight.

Jean-Luc Godard, the maker of \\\"A bout de souffle\\\", \\\"Le Mépris\\\" and \\\"Pierrot le fou\\\", idolized by critics and intellectuals, is shifting from revolutionizing cinema to becoming a revolutionary tout court. Isn't he shooting \\\"La Chinoise\\\", more a political tract in favor of Maoism than an actual movie? His female star is Anne Wiazemsky, writer François Mauriac's granddaughter, sixteen years his junior. Anne and Jean-Luc have been dating since 1966 and they marry this very year. She admires Jean-Luc's originality, intelligence, wit and boldness while he loves Anne's freshness and - admiration of him. But May 1968 puts their marriage to the test. Godard, who is more and more involved in the revolution, indeed becomes less and less available to his young wife, which does not prevent him from acting jealous. It also looks as if the genius is losing his sense of humor.

When harvest time comes, she makes up her mind to hire a farmhand but she is too late and no man is available. The mayor then recommends her an orphan named Francine Riant, who could do. Hortense agrees and the choice soon appears a blessing, as the girl proves perfect: well-mannered and respectful, she is also a hard worker who does not balk at any task. Hortense, Solange and her form an effective trio, who make the most of the situation. One day, Georges comes back to the farm on leave and he falls in love with Francine.
